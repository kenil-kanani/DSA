# Backtracking

### Pre Requisites
- Basic Java
- Recurtion in Java

### Introduction of Backtracking
 It is a technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build the solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions which fails to satisfy the constraints at any point of time.

### Types of Backtracking
1. **Decision Problem**
    - In this we search for a feasible(Possible) solution
    - Posible solution means something work for us
2. **Optimization Problem**
    - In this we look for the solution which will work best for us
3. **Enumeration Problem**
    - Enumeration means collection
    - Here we are targetting to find all the feasible solutions

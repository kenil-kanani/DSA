```
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head , fast = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null){
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if(slow == fast){
                while(head != slow){
                    head = head.next;
                    slow = slow.next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

Note : if there is cycle present in linkedList , then

number_of_steps_from_head_to_cycle_start == number_of_steps_from_"pqr"_to_cycle_start

where "pqr" is the point where slow and fast are mit during while loop...
